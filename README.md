**Competition**: Zindi – Ambulance Deployment Optimization
**Date**: 2019-2020
**Language**: R

## Task

Position 6 ambulances across Nairobi every 3 hours to minimize distance to reported traffic crashes during the test period (Jul-Dec 2019). Training data: 6,318 crashes from Jan 2018 to Jun 2019.

## Approach

A **two-stage system**: predict where crashes will happen, then place ambulances optimally.

1. **Stage 1 (Prediction)**: Binary classification at the (road segment × 3-hour window) level — will a crash occur here, now?
2. **Stage 2 (Deployment)**: Cluster predicted hotspots into 6 positions per time window.

## Engineering Decisions

### 1. Segment-Level ABT (Analytical Base Table)

Instead of predicting at individual lat/long points, the city is decomposed into ~800 road segments. Each segment becomes a row in the ABT, crossed with every 3-hour time window. This converts a spatial problem into a structured tabular classification.

### 2. Multi-Source Feature Fusion

Five data sources merged per segment per time window:
- **Crash history**: segment frequency, monthly elasticity, seasonal patterns
- **Road survey** (228 features): reduced to 2 dimensions via t-SNE
- **Uber Movement**: hourly speeds per OSM way, matched to segments
- **Weather**: temperature, humidity, wind, precipitation (simulated forward for test period)
- **Temporal**: hour bin, weekend, holidays

### 3. t-SNE for Obfuscated Road Survey Features

The 228 obfuscated road survey columns are reduced to 2 features via t-SNE (after NZV + correlation filtering). This captures the latent structure of road characteristics (crosswalks, obstacles, traffic behavior) without needing column semantics.

```r
tsne_out <- Rtsne(dr_final, dims = 2, perplexity = 25, max_iter = 7000)
```

### 4. Crash Elasticity as a Temporal Feature

Instead of using raw crash counts (which are always zero for the test period), compute month-over-month evolution per segment — the *trend*. Segments with increasing crash rates get higher predicted probabilities even without future crash data.

```r
elastic[, diff := (nb_crash_monthly - shift(nb_crash_monthly)) /
                  pmax(shift(nb_crash_monthly), 1), by = segment_id]
```

### 5. Weather Simulation for Test Period

Weather data only covers the training period. Future weather is simulated using year-over-year monthly adjustment: `weather_2019_m = weather_2018_m × (recent_trend_ratio)`. This preserves seasonal patterns without using future data.

### 6. Prediction → Deployment Conversion

The model outputs P(crash) per segment per window. Converting this to 6 ambulance positions:
- Take top-50 segments by predicted probability
- Cluster their midpoints into 6 groups (K-means)
- Place ambulances at cluster centroids

This ensures ambulances are distributed across predicted hotspots rather than concentrated at a single high-risk point.

### 7. Extreme Class Imbalance Handling

With ~0.1% positive rate (crash in a specific segment-window), stratified downsampling of negatives creates manageable training sets while preserving signal. Multiple subsets with different negative ratios feed into the ensemble.

# Akeed Restaurant Recommendation

**Competition**: Zindi – Akeed Restaurant Recommendation Challenge
**Date**: 2020
**Language**: R

## Task

Predict which of 100 restaurants each customer will order from, given customer locations, vendor information, and order history. ~35k train customers, ~10k test customers. Submission format: one row per (customer × location × vendor) triplet with a binary prediction.

## Approach

A **geography-first segmented recommendation engine** instead of standard collaborative filtering.

Why: with only 100 vendors, a strong delivery-radius constraint, and sparse interactions (most customers ordered from 1-2 vendors), the dominant signal is **spatial proximity within a demographic segment**, not user-item similarity.

## Engineering Decisions

### 1. Vendor Geographic Zones (K-Means)

Cluster vendors into 4 geographic zones based on coordinates. This creates the spatial structure that constrains recommendations — a customer won't order from a vendor 30km away.

```r
km_vend <- kmeans(
    x = vend_valid[, .(long_clean, lat_clean)],
    centers = 4,
    algorithm = "MacQueen",
    iter.max = 5000,
    nstart = 25
)
```

### 2. Customer Segmentation (18 segments)

Segment customers by: **gender** (3 levels) × **location count** (3 buckets) × **account tenure** (old/new). This captures behavioral groupings — a new male user with 1 address behaves differently from a long-tenured female with multiple delivery locations.

### 3. Vendor Tag Grouping

Original vendor tags are too granular (50+ unique tags). Grouped into 8 cuisine categories (Arabic, Indian, International, Desserts, Drinks, Sandwiches, Breakfast, Others) to make vendor profiles useful for matching.

### 4. Segment × Zone Recommendation

For each (segment, zone) pair in the test set:
- Find train customers in the same segment and zone who ordered
- Count vendor frequency (which vendors they ordered from)
- Score vendors for each test customer: `frequency / manhattan_distance`
- Recommend top-scoring vendors

### 5. Order Feature Engineering

Aggregate order history per (customer × location × vendor) triplet: order count, basket size, payment mode, ratings, delivery times, promo usage. These features characterize the customer-vendor relationship.

# Mental Health Text Classification

**Competition**: Zindi – AI4D iCompass Social Media Sentiment Analysis for Mental Health
**Date**: Late 2021
**Language**: R

## Task

Classify short free-text statements from Kenyan university students into four mental health categories: Depression, Alcohol, Suicide, Drugs. Statements respond to "What is on your mind?" and contain spelling errors, slang, and code-switching.

## Engineering Decisions

### 1. Spelling Correction Before Tokenization

Student text is noisy—misspellings fragment the vocabulary ("depressd", "deppressed", "depressed" → three separate tokens in TF-IDF). The pipeline applies UDPipe tokenization followed by hunspell correction, unifying variants before feature extraction. Kenyan slang terms (bhang, miraa) are whitelisted to avoid false corrections.

```r
tokens$is_correct <- hunspell_check(tokens$token)
slang_terms <- c("bhang", "miraa", "muguka", "shisha", "weed", "meth")
tokens$is_correct[tokens$token %in% slang_terms] <- TRUE
```

### 2. One-vs-Rest Decomposition

Rather than training a single multi-class model, each class gets its own binary classifier. This lets different models specialize—depression language patterns differ structurally from drug references. The ensemble averages probabilities across models independently per class.

### 3. TF-IDF + LSA (4 latent topics)

Sublinear TF-IDF with L2 normalization handles the short, variable-length statements. LSA with exactly 4 latent dimensions (matching the 4 classes) adds semantic structure to the sparse matrix, giving gradient-boosted models a denser signal.

### 4. Multiple Representation Strategies

The pipeline tests multiple embedding approaches in parallel:
- **TF-IDF + XGBoost**: sparse bag-of-words with boosting
- **GLMNet (Ridge)**: regularized logistic regression, strong on sparse text
- **Keras embedding**: learns task-specific 16-dim embeddings
- **StarSpace (ruimtehol)**: learns joint text-label embedding space

### 5. Simple Average Ensemble

With a small dataset (~600 train samples), a stacking meta-learner risks overfitting. Simple averaging of probability outputs from diverse model families (linear, tree, embedding-based) reduces variance while avoiding that risk.

# Malawi Flood Extent Prediction

Predicting the fraction of 1km² grid squares flooded in southern Malawi during Cyclone Idai (March 2019). Training data is the 2015 flood event. Evaluation: RMSE on flood fraction [0, 1]. Zindi competition sponsored by UNICEF and Arm.

## Key Engineering Decisions

**Train on one flood event, predict another.** The fundamental challenge is not generalization across rows — it's generalization across events. The model trained on 2015 data must predict 2019 (Cyclone Idai), a different storm with a different path, different rainfall distribution, and larger extent. Event-specific features from 2015 (individual week rainfall values) carry limited signal for 2019. The features that generalize are physical landscape invariants: terrain shape, soil properties, proximity to water. The pipeline prioritizes these.

**Terrain derivative features from elevation raster.** Elevation alone doesn't predict flooding — slope, flow direction, and terrain position do. A low-elevation flat plain pools water differently than a low-elevation hillside that drains rapidly. From the raw elevation grid, six terrain derivatives are computed:

```r
terrain_stack <- raster::terrain(
    rast_elev,
    opt = c("slope", "aspect", "tpi", "tri", "roughness", "flowdir"),
    unit = "degrees", neighbors = 8
)
```

- **TPI** (Terrain Position Index): is this cell a depression or a ridge?
- **TRI** (Terrain Ruggedness Index): how rough is the local surface?
- **flowdir**: which of the 8 cardinal directions does water drain toward?
- **hillshade**: a proxy for local exposure and shadow patterns

**Zero-inflated target decomposition.** ~70% of grid squares have zero flood extent. A regression model minimizing RMSE on zero-inflated data will be pulled toward near-zero predictions everywhere. The pipeline creates two auxiliary classification variables from the training target: `bin` (did it flood at all?) and `zero` (no / partial / severe), used for EDA, stratified splitting, and understanding where the regression error originates.

**Prediction clipping.** The target is a bounded fraction [0, 1]. Gradient boosting models can predict outside this range. All predictions are clipped before evaluation and submission:

```r
clip_predictions <- function(x) pmax(0, pmin(1, x))
```

**Soil infiltration variables as primary external data.** Soil drainage class, parent material, erosion type, and texture (from FAO/ISRIC soil maps) directly control the rate at which water infiltrates vs. pools. These are joined to each grid square and treated as first-class features alongside terrain.

# 5G Base Station Energy Consumption Prediction

Predicting energy consumption for 5G base stations from network load, energy-saving mode states, hardware configuration (antenna count, RU type, frequency/bandwidth), and time-of-day patterns. Competition dataset (2023), tabular regression.

## Key Engineering Decisions

**Target construction via frequency-weighted energy disaggregation.** The raw data records total energy at the base station level. For multi-cell stations (two cells operating at different frequencies), no per-cell energy measurement exists. To enable cell-level modeling, energy is attributed to each cell using frequency-specific proportions derived from hardware characteristics — `AVG_365`, `AVG_426`, `AVG_155`, `AVG_189`. Predicting cell energy is only possible after this attribution step. Without it, the label itself is undefined at the modeling granularity.

```r
energy <- energy %>%
  mutate(
    perct = case_when(
      nb_cell == 2 & freq_cat == '365'    ~ AVG_365,
      nb_cell == 2 & freq_cat == '426.98' ~ AVG_426,
      nb_cell == 2 & freq_cat == '155.6'  ~ AVG_155,
      nb_cell == 2 & freq_cat == '189'    ~ AVG_189,
      TRUE ~ 1
    ),
    target = Energy * perct
  )
```

**Domain-derived indicator features from hardware rules.** Features like `es1_load_low`, `es3_load_high`, `tree_energy_pack_F` are explicit interaction rules between energy-saving mode states, load levels, antenna counts, and frequencies. These encode known hardware behavior (e.g. ES1 activates under very low load with large antenna arrays) as binary flags rather than relying on the model to rediscover the interaction.

**Per-variable encoding strategy.** Each categorical variable receives an encoding matched to its structure: Helmert contrasts for `day_of_week` (ordered, sequential), polynomial contrasts for `RUType` (ordered by hardware generation), backward difference for `type_anten`, WoE for binary indicator flags, M-estimator smoothed encoding for `load_hour`. A separate dataset (`05_build_lightgbm_dataset.R`) is built with these pre-encoded representations specifically for LightGBM.

**Two-level modeling: base station and cell.** Models are trained independently at both granularities. Base-level models use aggregated cell features; cell-level models use individual cell observations. Final submission blends predictions from both levels.

**Three-way train / freeze / test split.** A dedicated freeze set is held out for ensemble weight optimization and model comparison, separate from both training and final test.

## Best Practices Applied

1. **Modular Design**: Each script has a single responsibility
2. **Configuration Separation**: All constants in 00_config.R
3. **Consistent Naming**: Files numbered in execution order
4. **Documentation**: Detailed comments and headers
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing files
6. **Reproducibility**: Seeds set for all random operations
7. **Reusable Functions**: Helper functions in 02_feature_engineering.R
8. **Pipeline Orchestration**: MAIN.R for easy execution

## Notes

- The freeze set is used for local validation before submission
- Cell-level predictions need aggregation to base level for submission
- Some models (H2O, SL3) may require additional installation steps
- Run times vary significantly by model (LightGBM ~5min, H2O AutoML ~30min)
